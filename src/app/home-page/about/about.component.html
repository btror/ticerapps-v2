            In addition to my professional work, I have also developed several applications independently. One notable
            project is ticerapps.com, where I single-handedly designed, developed, and deployed a range of innovative
            and user-friendly applications. This experience allowed me to further enhance my skills in various web
            development technologies and gain valuable insights into the full project lifecycle.
